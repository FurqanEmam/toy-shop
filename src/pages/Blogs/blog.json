  {
    "question": "How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?",
    "answer": "Access tokens are typically sent along with requests to access protected resources, while refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens from the authorization server. Access tokens should be stored securely on the client-side, usually in memory or secure storage mechanisms such as HTTP cookies or browser's local storage.",

    "question": "Compare SQL and NoSQL databases.",
    "answer": "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They are table-based and have predefined schemas. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that use a variety of data models for accessing and managing data. They are more flexible and scalable than SQL databases and do not require a fixed schema.",
